# Purchase Planner

Plan the construction materials you need to buy, record every purchase per supplier, and see where the money goes. Works as a website and as an Android app (APK).

## What it does
- **Board**: **To purchase** cards on the left, **Purchased** cards on the right. Every card is one thing the site needs, and it is split in two:
  - **Left: Need to purchase.** The item, how many you need (with unit: bags, pcs, sheets, m, cu.m …), the budget price, project or area, priority and needed-by date.
  - **Right: Purchase items.** One line for each purchase, so the same item can come from different suppliers. For example 10 pcs from Supplier 1 and 15 pcs from Supplier 2. Each line keeps the supplier, quantity, price each, date and receipt / DR number. A progress bar shows how much of the quantity is bought and how many are still to go.
  - Press **+ Add purchase** on a card to add a line. When the lines add up to the quantity needed, the card moves to **Purchased** by itself. If you stop short, press **✓ Mark purchased** to close it anyway. **↩ Move back** puts it back on the To purchase side (you can also drag cards across on a computer).
  - Search by item, project or supplier, filter by category, and sort at the top. On a phone the two sides are shown one at a time with a switch at the top.
- **Reports**: total spent, purchases recorded, saved or over budget, spending by category, supplier, month and project, what is still to purchase, biggest purchases, and the full purchase log. Pick the period (this month, last 30 days, 3 months, this year, all time). Copy or download the purchase log and the items list as CSV.
- **Paid from:** every purchase line says where the money came from: **COH** (cash on hand), **BANK**, or a split where you type how much came from COH and how much from BANK (they must add up to the purchase total). The card shows it on each line, and the card totals show how much came out of each.
- **Budget**: type your **COH Balance** (available cash on hand) and **BANK Balance** (available bank balance) at the top. The Board shows the **Remaining** COH and BANK: your balance minus every card in **Purchased**, using the COH / BANK choice on each of its purchase lines (the purchase form warns when one runs short). Cards still on the To purchase side do not take money out yet; moving a card back gives it back. Type the real amounts again any time to correct them. Below that, set a monthly budget and see how much is left and what you can spend per day. Optional limits for each category, with warning colours when you get close.
- **Settings**: currency symbol, your own categories, and your data options.

Every message and confirmation is styled inside the app. There are no plain browser popups.

## Where your data is saved
- **Default: this device only.** Nothing to set up. The app starts with sample construction items so you can try it. Go to **Settings > Clear all items** to start fresh.
- **Optional: a Google Sheet,** so your phone and computer (or two people) share the same list. Do this once:
  1. Go to https://sheets.new and create a blank sheet.
  2. **Extensions > Apps Script**. Delete the sample code, paste everything from `apps-script/Code.gs`, and change `change-me` on the `PASSWORD` line to your own password. Press **Save**.
  3. Pick **setup** in the function drop-down and press **Run**. Allow the permissions Google asks for (Advanced > Go to project > Allow).
  4. **Deploy > New deployment > Web app**. Set **Execute as: Me** and **Who has access: Anyone**. Press **Deploy** and copy the Web app URL.
  5. Paste that URL between the quotes in `js/config.js` (`SCRIPT_URL`), save, and upload the change to GitHub.
  
  If you set up a sheet with the earlier version of this app, delete its **Items** tab first, then run **setup** again. The columns changed (each item now holds its list of purchases).

  After that the app asks for the password the first time you add or change something. Never put your real password in the `Code.gs` file that you upload to GitHub; only the copy inside Apps Script needs it. Anyone with the website link can read the list, but only people with the password can change it.

## Put it online (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repository on GitHub and upload everything in this folder (use GitHub Desktop if the browser upload complains about the number of files).
2. **Settings > Pages**: Source **Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`. After a minute or two your site is live at `https://YOUR-NAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`.
3. On a phone, open that address in Chrome and choose **Add to Home screen** to install it like an app.

## Android app
